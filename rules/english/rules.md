# Koruboddo 2: Rules

## Board and Pieces
- **Grid**: 6 x 6 board.
- **Pieces**: Each player has 12 pieces.
- **Composition**:
    - **Army (Soldiers)**: 8 pieces (Normal type).
    - **Special Soldier**: 2 pieces (Can make an additional move after capture to escape).
    - **Guardian**: 1 piece (Protects other pieces in the same grid from capture).
    - **Leader**: 1 piece (Can move more than 1 step).

## Movement
- Pieces move one step per turn (except for the Leader).
- Pieces can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) if the destination is not occupied.

## Capture Mechanics
- This is a "jump and capture" game.
- To capture an enemy piece:
    1. You must be in a position adjacent to the enemy.
    2. The position directly behind the enemy must be empty.
    3. You jump over the enemy piece to the empty position.
- Multiple captures are allowed in a single turn if the conditions are met.
